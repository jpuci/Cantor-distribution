# Cantor-distributiuon
Analysis of Cantor distribution in python jupyter notebook.
Colaborators on this project: Katarzyna Gunia (https://github.com/kasiagunia); Joanna Zema (https://github.com/J-Zema).
Project consists of implementation of algorythm generating pseudorandom numbers from Cantor distribution, generalization of said distribution. Analysis of generator performance as well as interesting cases of generalization are presented in this project. Unfortunatelly comments to the results are aviable only in Polish.
